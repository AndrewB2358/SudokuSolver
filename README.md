# SudokuSolver
Python code to solver Sudoku puzzles as with different Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques

This program was made in my AI class to solve CSPs with different methods. The program has been modified to have a GUI (using pygame) and allows the user to easily try the 
different methods
